    "paragraph2": "My interest in software development began in 2020 when I enrolled in my first project-based courses during my undergraduate studies. These courses were designed to emulate real-world environments, requiring us to work in software teams. Together with my teams, I implemented new features for the UCSB admin panel, which are now used by the university faculty, and created a full-stack social media web app from scratch. I found immense joy in bringing innovative ideas to life through web development and realized it was the path I wanted to pursue.",
