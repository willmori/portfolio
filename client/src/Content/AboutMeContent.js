    "paragraph2": "My interest in software development started back in 2020 when I took my first project based classes during my undergrad. These courses were designed to emulate real-world environments, having us work in software teams. With my teams, I was able to implement new features for the UCSB admin panel to be used by the university faculty and create a full-stack social media web app from scratch. I found so much enjoyment in bringing awesome ideas to life through web development that I knew its what I wanted to pursue.",
